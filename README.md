# SalesAnalysisProject

This project aims to analyze and visualize sales data from the Australian Apparel Sales dataset for the 4th quarter of 2020. The objective is to identify trends, patterns, and insights, including sales performance across different states, groups, and over time. By using various data wrangling and visualization techniques, we were able to derive actionable recommendations for business strategies.
